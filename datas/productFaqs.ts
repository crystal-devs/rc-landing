        question: "How does RC Landing work?",
        answer: "RC Landing creates a unique QR code for your event. Guests scan the code with their phone camera (no app download required) and can instantly upload photos/videos. All content appears in real-time on your event display, creating an interactive photo wall that everyone can enjoy."
    },
    {
        question: "Do guests need to download an app?",
        answer: "No! RC Landing works directly through the phone's web browser. Guests simply scan a QR code and start uploading immediately. This makes it incredibly easy for everyone to participate, regardless of their phone type or technical skills."
    },
    {
        question: "How much does it cost?",
        answer: "We offer flexible pricing starting with a free tier for small events (up to 50 photos). Paid plans start at $29/month for unlimited events and photos. Enterprise plans are available for large organizations with custom features."
    },
    {
        question: "Can I moderate the photos before they appear?",
        answer: "Yes! You have full control over content moderation. Choose from automatic AI-powered filtering, manual approval workflows, or let everything appear instantly. You can also remove inappropriate content at any time."
    },
    {
        question: "How many people can upload photos at once?",
        answer: "RC Landing is built to handle hundreds of simultaneous uploads. Whether you have 20 guests at a wedding or 500 attendees at a conference, our infrastructure scales automatically to handle the load."
    },
    {
        question: "Can I use RC Landing for multiple events?",
        answer: "Absolutely! Each account can manage multiple events simultaneously. You can create different QR codes for different events, and each event maintains its own photo collection and settings."
    },
    {
        question: "What happens to the photos after the event?",
        answer: "Photos are stored securely in the cloud for 30 days after the event (free tier) or up to 1 year on paid plans. You can download all photos as a ZIP file, and guests can access their uploaded content through a private link."
    },
    {
        question: "Is my data secure?",

    },
    {
        question: "Can I customize the look of the photo wall?",
        answer: "Yes! You can customize colors, layouts, and branding to match your event theme. Add your logo, choose from different display styles, and even include custom messaging or sponsor information."
    },
    {
        question: "What if I need help during my event?",
        answer: "Our support team is available 24/7 during events. You can reach us through chat, email, or phone. We also provide detailed setup guides and have a comprehensive knowledge base for common questions."
